    "# Multi-step Cooking Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we change how the cooking process works and break it donwn into four sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Equipment Prep\n",
    "2. Ingredients Prep\n",
    "3. Cooking\n",
    "4. Garnish\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a more structured input for the agent to work with and allows us to better control the flow of the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach seems more favourable given a single cooking session is noisy, messy, and often requires a lot of back and forth between the user and the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hoped that a lot of the complexity regards to the cooking process can be handled upfront in steps 1 & 2, leaving a good impression to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cooking step itself is then minimised to the least number of steps possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we investigate how a recipe consisting of 'ingredients' and 'instructions' can be transformed into this 4 step process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a prompt and the original recipe, we use a simple structured output from an LLM to populate a `RecipeSteps` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Recipe (title, ingredients, instructions) --> LLM --> Structured Output --> RecipeSteps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Small models (of size ~4GB) are not powerful enough to handle this task reliably.\n",
    "2. gemini-2.5-flash-lite works well, reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporate this into the main voice agent + a flow to be used to interact with the client."
